<strong>ðŸ‘‹ Hello!</strong>

I'm Mark Forsyth, and I really enjoy coding. These days I think of it more like an art form than anything else, and I love how much creating, puzzling, and designing goes into any given programming project.

My skills center around:
- Web Development (ReactJS, TypeScript, NextJS, plain HTML/CSS/JS)
- Python3
- Unity C#

I'm always dabbling around with new languages (e.g. Go, Rust, Elm . . .), and I'm excited to learn more.

I'm in the market for internships, part-time, or contract work. Feel free to contact me at [marktforsyth@gmail.com](mailto:marktforsyth@gmail.com). I look forward to hearing from you.

<em>P.S.</em>

I'm really interested in the theory behind different programming paradigms and principles such as typesafety, declarative programming, immutability, functional programming, and overall language design. Oh also, ui design--I have so many thoughts.

If you also like to think about programming theory, don't hesitate to reach out and maybe we can bounce ideas off of each other! If not, stay tuned--I'll probably start blogging about it soon . . .
