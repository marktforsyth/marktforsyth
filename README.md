<b>ðŸ‘‹ Hi!</b>

I'm Mark Forsyth, an emerging programmer with a passion for programming and the many problems it can solve.

My skills are mainly centered in...
- Web Development (ReactJS, NextJS, plain HTML/CSS/JS)
- Python3
- Unity C#

I'm always dabbling around with new languages (e.g. Go, Rust,...), and I'm always willing to learn. I've spent quite a bit of time recently in ReactJS, but right now I'm revisiting Python3 in a programming class, and I'm developing a deeper appreciation for it than I've ever had before!

I'm looking for/open to any project work or internships that are available, so don't hesitate to contact me at [marktforsyth@gmail.com](mailto:marktforsyth@gmail.com).
